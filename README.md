# Internship-Projects
Consists of some of the projects I worked on during my time as an intern. Because of there policy, I wasn't able to get a vast majority
of the web projects I worked on. I have here only partials. I was use this to explain some of the projects I worked on there.

## Final Fantasy 
This project consisted of 3 projects: Get the data into a database, build an API to utilise that database, and build a web application
to consume the data. For the data, I chose to get information about Final Fantasy 14 from the wiki.

* Screen Scraper Project
  * Extracted information about the game from the wiki site using the .net framework. 
  * Stored it into a Microsot SQL Server DB

* Web API Project
  * created a webapi that retrieved the information from the database using the .Net Web API 2 template
  * sent infomration in the form on Json or XML.
  * Used the N-Tier design pattern when I created this
  
* Web Application
  * Used the .net MVC template to create this
  * used React on the front end  
  
 ## Street-Songs
 This was a team project I worked on with two other people. The objective of this app was to play music in a raidius of your GSP location
 using the google maps API and other people using the app in your area would be able to listen and play their own music too.
  * MeteorJS for the back-end
  * Angular on the front-end
